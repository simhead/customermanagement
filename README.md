# Swagger Jersey generated server

## Usage Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled JAX-RS server.

This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the swagger listing here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

SOLUTION REQUIREMENT:
Design a RESTful API using RAML that contains a single resource, customers, and allows the following:
•   List customers
•   Create a new customer
•   Update a customer
•   Deletes a customer
You may constrain the customer object to first name, last name and addresses, and the format to JSON.

Tools and libs:
1. Jetty server for handling API request
2. Mysql instance running in cloud docker container: jdbc:mysql://simdocker.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:3306/listtest
3. Table definition for Customer schema
4. used Java Persistence API for DB connectivity and Jinq for DB queries
5. Postman for REST API testing:
	- http://localhost:8080/listCustomers with GET
	- http://localhost:8080/addCustomer with POST
	- http://localhost:8080/customer/test with PUT
	- http://localhost:8080/customer/test with DELETE
	
RAML location: ./RAML/customer.raml

Issues:
1. slow db connection due to server being located in remote US - only applicable for first call, subsequent calls are using cached dB connection.	

Future expansion:
1. Products and Orders are defined in the placeholder for future expansion.
