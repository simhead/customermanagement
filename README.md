# Swagger Jersey generated server

## Usage Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled JAX-RS server.

This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the swagger listing here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

## SOLUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Design a RESTful API using RAML that contains a single resource, customers, and allows the following:
	- List customers
	- Create a new customer
	- Update a customer
	- Deletes a customer
You may constrain the customer object to first name, last name and addresses, and the format to JSON.

## APPROACH:
- Design:> used https://studio.restlet.com studio to define/design API specification
- Development:> 
	- restlet studio to export to RAML 1.0
	- eclipse for development IDE
	- GIT for source code version control
	- swagger-codegen for Java (JAX-RS) server stubs
	- Jetty server for handling API request/response
	- maven for building and running server environment
	- json-simple library for handing json string
	- mysql server for data storage
	- docker to run mysql server as a containerized DB server
	- mysql-connect and JPA (Java Persistence API) libraries for DB connection
	- jinq library for handling DB queries
- Test:> used Postman for REST API testing:
	- http://localhost:8080/listCustomers with GET
	- http://localhost:8080/addCustomer with POST
	- http://localhost:8080/customer/test with PUT
	- http://localhost:8080/customer/test with DELETE

```

RAML location: ./RAML/customer.raml
```

## Issues:
- slow db connection due to server being located in remote US - only applicable for first call, subsequent calls are using cached dB connection.	

## Future expansion:
- Products and Orders are defined in the placeholder for future expansion and use customerID for primary key relationship.
